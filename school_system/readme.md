# School System

## About

This project is a work in progress. The School System aims to provide a simple Python-based management tool for handling school and student data. It demonstrates basic file handling, JSON data manipulation, and user authentication. More features and improvements will be added as development continues.

## Files

- **school_details.json**: Contains information about the school (name, location, contact details, etc.).
- **student_details.json**: Stores student records including username, password, email, and active status.
- **school_details.py**: Defines the school name as a Python variable.
- **student_dashboard.py**: Main script for student login and dashboard functionality.
